Applications don't do the best until they are calibrated for its functioning and testing is not just about writing code it's how robust and
error-free product stands up in the market.
 Yep!! I learned Unit Testing using Java with Junit 5 and respectively,
so, what interested me here's a short one of it:
 For giving a toe to toe and head-to-head competition we have to be beautiful from the inside i.e. are the "units" 
 working individually
 and are working as a single being at its optimum or lagging behind.
  Similar to a single cell contributes to the larger function similarly a single method is tested to check if it gives output
 in the desired timeframe, is the output similar to what I desired. As a developer this is the only thing I require: 
 "Output Vahi aave jo Chahiye, baaki kuch bhi jais hai".
